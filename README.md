Hi, I'm Paige!
I make queer comfortcore games~  🎮🍵🌷

I've been a coder, producer, and events organizer in the industry for 10 years.
I'm now learning pixel art and game design!

Games I've helped ship include [🏫 LongStory](https://www.longstorygame.com/), [⌛ Later Daters](https://www.laterdatersgame.com/), [🤖 2064: Read Only Memories](https://2064.io/), and of course my [🌙 Yurivania series](https://mxashlynn.itch.io/yurivania).

I hope you find something you like here! 💖🎶
